&lt;p&gt;Documents:
- Full I-140 petition
- I-485 petition
- I-140 and I-485 LaTeX templates (an adaptation of the template by (Razvan Marinescu)[&lt;a href=&#34;https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/]&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/]&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recently received my U.S. green card after successfully petitioning under the EB-1A category as an alien of extraordinary ability in sciences.
I prepared and filed my petition without help of a law firm or attorney. I, however, learned and benefited from petition examples of other scientists that I found online and from a couple petitions shared with me by friends. I decided to also release my complete petition with the hope that it can be helpful for others who want to build their own applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am originally from Russia where I also completed my undergraduate studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administrative processing
Not able to travel
A friend successfully self-petitioned for EB2-NIW without lawyers before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Russian national with a PhD from EPFL in Switzerland. My research background is in data privacy and computer security. At the time of petitioning, I had just finished my third year of being a postdoc in the U.S., had five peer-reviewed publications, two of which as the first author, and around 300 citations. So, I had a reasonable but not an outstanding profile. The one thing that helped me to substantiate my petition was that a tiny piece of my prior work was used in iMessage and in Facebook Messenger. I heavily used this in my petition, &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; exaggerating its impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example that I relied on the most was by (Razvan Marinescu)[&lt;a href=&#34;https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/&lt;/a&gt;] who had self-petitioned and got approved under the same category in 2021. Another useful example (for both EB-1 and EB2-NIW) is by Andrey Solovyev. Finally, the Oscar&amp;rsquo;s Green Card Youtube channel is a useful resource to understand the basics of the petition process and hear testimonies of other people with approved DIY petitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and none of the information here is a legal advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perception is that you have either a sure-acceptance case or a complicated situation, then getting assistance from an attorney is useful and might cut down your preparation time. But if you are a scientist with a reasonable but not outstanding profile (basically like mine), you will have higher chances of getting approved by preparing the petition yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May, 2024: Start studying the options and aimed for EB-2 NIW
July, 2024: Decide to switch to EB-1 to avoid priority date wait
December, 2024: Exhibits are collected and the petition is mostly written
January, 2025: Start contacting potential support-letter writers and drafting the letters
March, 2025: All the support letters are received&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 1, 2025: Send my I-140 EB-1A petition with the I-907 Form for Premium Processing (15 business days processing guarantee)
April 4, 2025: I-140 petition is received by USCIS
April 9, 2025: Case is being actively reviewed
April 10, 2025: I-140 petition is accepted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 24, 2025: I-485 petition is received by USCIS
&amp;hellip;, 2025: Request for biometrics
&amp;hellip;, 2025: Green card approved
&amp;hellip;, 2025: Green card received&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-140&#34;&gt;I-140&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eight letters of support
Someone who actually knows your work but have not directly collaborated with you. Out of eight recommenders, two were my formers research advisors, four were university professors who knew me and my work a little bit (because we either met at a conference, I gave a talk at their seminar at some point, or I previously interviewed to work with them), and two were from applied scientists from a tech company that used my work in their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;degree evaluations ($85 for evaluating three degrees)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;structure&#34;&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the high-level impact of my work and relevance to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews in exhibits: an email with the invitation to join the PC or to provide an expert review, then screenshots for each review.
I was able to log in into every platform / venue I reviewed for and find a copy of my review.
I used GoFullPage browser extension to make screenshots of long reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-485&#34;&gt;I-485&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors: fidi but also options in astoria and flushing (if you are in nyc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation: used Itrex ($10 for translating a USSR-issued birth certificate)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Padded Uniform Random Blobs (PURBs)</title>
      <link>https://nikirill.com/project/purbs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nikirill.com/project/purbs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most encrypted data formats leak metadata via their plaintext headers, such as format version, encryption schemes used,
number of recipients who can decrypt the data, and even the recipients’ identities.
This leakage can pose security and privacy risks to users, e.g., by revealing the full membership of a group of
collaborators from a single encrypted e-mail, or by enabling an eavesdropper to fingerprint the precise encryption
software version and configuration the sender used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose that future encrypted data formats improve security and privacy hygiene by producing
&lt;em&gt;Padded Uniform Random Blobs&lt;/em&gt; or PURBs: ciphertexts indistinguishable from random bit strings to anyone without
a decryption key. A PURB’s content leaks &lt;em&gt;nothing at all&lt;/em&gt;, even the application that created it, and is padded
such that even its length leaks as little as possible.
Encoding and decoding ciphertexts with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; cleartext markers presents efficiency challenges, however.
We present cryptographically agile encodings enabling legitimate recipients to decrypt a PURB efficiently, even
when encrypted for any number of recipients’ public keys and/or passwords, and when these public keys
are from different cryptographic suites. PURBs employ Padmé, a novel padding scheme that limits information leakage
via ciphertexts of maximum length &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; to a practical optimum of O(log log &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;) bits, comparable to
padding to a power of two, but with lower overhead of at most 12% and decreasing with larger payloads.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Security of software-update systems</title>
      <link>https://nikirill.com/project/chainiac/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software-update mechanisms are critical to the security of modern systems, but their typically centralized design
presents a lucrative and frequently attacked target. In this work, we propose CHAINIAC, a decentralized software-update
framework that eliminates single points of failure, enforces transparency, and provides efficient verifiability of
integrity and authenticity for software-release processes. Independent &lt;em&gt;witness servers&lt;/em&gt; collectively verify
conformance of software updates to release policies, &lt;em&gt;build verifiers&lt;/em&gt; validate the source-to-binary correspondence,
and a tamper-proof release log stores collectively signed updates, thus ensuring that no release is accepted by clients
before being widely disclosed and validated. The release log embodies a skipchain, a novel data structure, enabling
arbitrarily out-of-date clients to efficiently validate updates and signing keys.
Evaluation of our CHAINIAC prototype on reproducible Debian packages shows that the automated update process takes
the average of 5 minutes per release for individual packages, and only 20 seconds for the aggregate timeline.
We further evaluate the framework using real-world data from the PyPI package repository and show that it offers
clients security comparable to verifying every single update themselves while consuming only one-fifth of the bandwidth
and having a minimal computational overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
